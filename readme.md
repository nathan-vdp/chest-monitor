<p>A simple yet powerful tool that helps you monitor the status of a chest in Computercraft!</p>

<!-- Useage -->
## Installation
1. Download the `install.lua` file to your in-game computer using the `wget` command.
   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nathan-vdp/chest-monitor/main/install.lua

2. Run the `install.lua` script.
```bash
lua install.lua
```
3. This script does two things:
   - It downloads another script named `chest_monitor.lua` from this repository. This is the script that monitors the chest in the game.

   - It creates a `startup.lua` script. This script ensures that the `chest_monitor.lua` script automatically starts when you boot up the computer.
