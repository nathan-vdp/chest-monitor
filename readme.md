# Chest Monitor

👋 Welcome to Chest Monitor! This is a simple yet powerful tool that helps you monitor the status of a chest in your game.

## 🚀 How to Install

1. ▶ Download the `install.lua` script from this repository. This is a special script that handles the installation for you.
2. ▶ Run the `install.lua` script. This script does two things:
   - It downloads another script named `chest_monitor.lua` from this repository. This is the script that monitors the chest in the game.
   
   - It creates a `startup.lua` script. This script ensures that the `chest_monitor.lua` script automatically starts when you boot up the computer.

## 🎯 How to Use

After installation, the chest monitor will automatically start when you boot up the computer. If you want to start it manually, you can run the `chest_monitor.lua` script.
